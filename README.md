# Network Analysis of Game of Thrones

This project is to analyze the network of characters in Game of Thrones and how it changes over the course of the books.

## Project Description:
Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). And also look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

#### Requirements:
For this project, you should be familiar with the 
* networkx package
* different network centrality measures
* pandas package
* manipulate DataFrames

## Dataset Details:
This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available [here](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf). <br>
For more information on this dataset have a look at the [Network of Thrones blog](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/).

## Project Tasks:
1. &nbsp;Winter is Coming. Let's load the dataset ASAP!
2. &nbsp;Time for some Network of Thrones
3. &nbsp;Populate the network with the DataFrame
4. &nbsp;The most important character in Game of Thrones
5. &nbsp;The evolution of character importance
6. &nbsp;What's up with Stannis Baratheon?
7. &nbsp;What does Google PageRank tell us about GoT?
8. &nbsp;Correlation between different measures
9. &nbsp;Conclusion
